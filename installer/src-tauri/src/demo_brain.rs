//! A local stand-in for a real Second Brain, so demo mode has data to operate on.
//!
//! `SECOND_BRAIN_DRY_RUN=1` used to point the app at
//! `https://second-brain.demo.workers.dev`, which does not resolve. Every
//! Worker-backed screen therefore failed with "Couldn't reach your Second
//! Brain" — the Advanced Settings window would not open at all, and the
//! embedding-migration pane could not be exercised even once.
//!
//! # Why a real server rather than a `dry_run` branch
//!
//! The obvious fix is an `if session.dry_run` early return inside
//! [`crate::settings::fetch_settings`] and friends. That would prove nothing: the
//! request, the JSON parsing, the status mapping and the error copy would all be
//! skipped, so a clean demo run would say only that the short-circuit works.
//!
//! Instead this binds a real `tiny_http` listener on `127.0.0.1:0` and demo mode
//! is handed its address. `fetch_settings`, `apply_settings`, `reset_control`,
//! `fetch_estimate`, `run_batch` and `fetch_status` then execute completely
//! unchanged — real HTTP, real bearer auth, real deserialisation, real error
//! mapping. A demo run is evidence about the shipping code path.
//!
//! `tiny_http` is already a production dependency: [`crate::cf::oauth`] uses it
//! for the Cloudflare loopback callback. Nothing new is pulled in.
//!
//! # The config is derived, never typed out
//!
//! [`shipped_config`] is built from [`crate::settings::DEFAULT_LEVELS`] and the
//! levels in [`crate::settings::CONTROLS`], so the demo brain reports exactly the
//! keys and values the controls write. A hardcoded blob would drift the moment a
//! level was retuned, and the window would open showing "Custom" for a brain that
//! is in fact untouched — the single most misleading thing this could do.
