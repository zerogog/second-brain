/**
 * The setup spine - what the left rail draws, and which of its steps a user is
 * allowed to click their way back into.
 *
 * Setup has never had a fixed number of screens: creating a brain, connecting
 * to one you already have, and pasting a team token are three different walks
 * through the same file, and half the screens in `main.ts` are transient (a
 * scan running), a question asked once (which Cloudflare account?), or a guard
 * that stopped before touching anything. A rail that counted screens would
 * therefore count something different for every user, and would jump backwards
 * every time a guard interrupted.
 *
 * So the rail counts *steps*, and every screen maps onto one. Transient
 * screens, pickers and guards resolve to the step they belong to and mark the
 * rail paused rather than adding a position of their own - which is why this
 * whole module is a pair of pure lookups over plain data, exported for
 * `test/unit/steps.test.ts` the same way `ridge.ts` and `rotation-state.ts`
 * export theirs. `main.ts` supplies the screen name and the path; nothing here
 * touches the DOM or the wizard's mutable state.
