 *

 * and why it was wrong.
 *
 * Derived, never stored: a member promoted to admin in the dashboard would
 * otherwise keep whatever this app decided on the day they installed it.
 *
 * Imports nothing, deliberately - `main.ts` resolves `#app` at module scope and

/**

 * The same answer as `canRotatePassword`, for the same reason and not by
 * coincidence: both redeploy something inside the Cloudflare account the Worker
 * lives in, and `start_worker_update` resolves that account by matching the
 * brain's workers.dev subdomain against the signed-in session. A team admin has
 * no more access to it than a member does, so "admin" does not unlock this.
 *
 * The desktop app self-updates from GitHub Releases with no Cloudflare
 * involvement, which is why this matters: a member keeping their app current
 * pushes their BUNDLED Worker version ahead of the team's DEPLOYED one, so
 * `is_behind` is true on every launch and stays true until the owner acts.
 * Without this gate they were offered the update every single time, and it
 * could never succeed.
 *
 * `legacyWorker` is the escape hatch's own escape hatch, and it exists because
 * the gate above, alone, is a DEADLOCK. The app self-updates from GitHub
 * Releases and the Worker can only be updated FROM the app, so the app is always
 * ahead of the deployment. On a brain whose deployed Worker predates `owner`:
 * `/team/me` answers without it → the role is indeterminate → least privilege
 * suppresses this route → and this route is the only thing that deploys the
 * Worker that adds `owner`. The way out was gated on a capability only the
 * version you are trying to reach reports.
 *
 * So a POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED legacy Worker (answered, well formed, no `owner`
 * key - not "the probe failed", which stays suppressed) opens this one route.
 * That is not a weakening: `start_worker_update` resolves the hosting account
 * by matching the brain's workers.dev subdomain against the signed-in
 * Cloudflare session and answers ErrorWrongCfAccount to anyone else, so the
 * real gate here was never the role. And it self-heals - after one successful
 * update the brain can say who is asking, and this argument is false forever
 * after.
 *
 * THE ASYMMETRY WITH `canRotatePassword` IS DELIBERATE. Do not simplify the two
 * back into one rule. Rotation gets no legacy allowance because rotation is not
 * a way out of anything: nobody needs a new password to update a Worker, the
 * card comes back on its own once the Worker can answer, and unlike this route
 * the app cannot tell an owner from a member while it is suppressed.
 *
 * Defaults to false so that a caller who has not thought about it gets the
 * least-privileged answer rather than the allowance.
