   *
   * This used to be a hardcoded constant naming the owner, on the reasoning
   * that the webview never handles the token - it stays in the Rust core - so
   * this window had nothing to call `/team/me` with. It now has:
   * `connection_role` asks on its behalf. The constant meant every team member
   * who opened this window from the menu or the tray read "You're signed in as
   * this brain's owner-admin" and was offered a "Change my password" button
   * that walks them through a Cloudflare sign-in and inventing a password
   * before failing with ErrorWrongCfAccount - one click from a setup screen
   * that had just called them a member.
   *
   * A solo brain asks nothing at all: `teamMode` comes from the keychain, and
   * `roleFromDetailsProbe` short-circuits on it before any request. Any failure
   * - the command erroring, an unreachable brain, a Worker too old for the
   * route - is a `null` probe, which resolves to "member": the least-privileged
   * answer, because the cost of under-claiming here is a hidden button and the

 * that walks them through a Cloudflare sign-in before failing.

 * asking, so the button is offered to whoever opened this window - otherwise
 * the brain could never be updated to the version that can say (see
 * `canUpdateWorker`). The copy has to be straight about that. Being offered a
