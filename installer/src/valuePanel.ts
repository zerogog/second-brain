/**
 * The value panel - the testimonial setup opens each screen with.
 *
 * Most setup screens ask for one thing and then wait: a password typed, an
 * account chosen, a brain unlocked. The rail on the left says how much is
 * left; the column asks the question. This is the argument for answering it,
 * and it is one real person's published words plus the three facts a first-run
 * user is actually weighing (how long, how much, whose account).
 *
 * It used to be a 340px card in the corner of the right gutter, below the
 * fold, faded out whenever Ridge had anything to say. That put the one thing
 * on screen written to convince somebody in the quietest place the window
 * has. It is now the editorial opening: a full-width pull quote above the
 * task, at the size the words deserve, with the three facts as a foot strip
 * under the whole composition.
 *
 * Three rules shape the data below:
 *
 * 1. One quote per screen, fixed. The mapping is a table rather than a
 *    rotation or a shuffle so that a re-render - a locale change, a rail
 *    refresh, a failed check redrawing the same screen - puts the same words
 *    back. A quote that changed its mind while the user was reading it would
 *    pull the eye off the field they were filling in, and it is now big
 *    enough that the movement would be impossible to ignore.
 * 2. `null` means the screen is busy or finished. Provisioning, its failure
 *    screen and the connection details are the three places that are either
 *    carrying real status or holding the payoff, and marketing copy alongside
 *    either one reads as a shrug. The three launch modes (`rotation`,
 *    `workerUpdate`, `stalePassword`) are not onboarding at all: nobody
 *    changing a password needs to be sold the app they already installed.
 * 3. Quotes are other people's words, so they are stored verbatim in one
 *    place and are never translated. Only the furniture around them - the
 *    kicker, the source labels, the stat line - goes through `t()`.
 *
 * Like `steps.ts`, this module is plain data and pure lookups with no DOM in
 * it, so `test/unit/valuePanel.test.ts` can check the mapping without a
 * webview. `main.ts` renders it.
