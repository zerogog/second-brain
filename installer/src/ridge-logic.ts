// Ridge's pure decision logic: the seen-set, the typing gate, the reveal and

// machine. No DOM, no storage, no imports - deliberately.
//
// This lives apart from `ridge.ts` rather than merely being exported from it,
// because `ridge.ts` imports `./shared` and `./i18n` for the DOM half. Those
// pull DOM globals and `@tauri-apps/api` into anything that touches this file,
// and the repo-root `tsc` (Worker-typed: `lib: ["ES2022"]`, no DOM) follows
// imports regardless of its `include`. So a test importing this logic from
// `ridge.ts` broke the root typecheck. Same arrangement, and same reason, as
// `rotation-state.ts` and `connection-role.ts`.
