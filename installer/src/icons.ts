// The icon set, as data. No imports - deliberately.
//
// `shared.ts` (where these used to live) imports `./i18n` and
// `@tauri-apps/api/core` for its DOM helpers. Anything importing `IconName`
// from there therefore pulled DOM globals and the Tauri API into its program,
// including the repo-root `tsc`, which is Worker-typed and has neither. Path
// data has no reason to carry that, so it sits on its own.

/* ── Icons ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every mark in this app is one of these. There are no emoji anywhere in the
 * UI: an emoji is a font, and a font is rendered by the host OS - the same
 * character is a flat glyph on one machine, a gradient sticker on another, and
 * a tofu box on a machine missing the range. None of those is a design
 * decision, and setup has to look like itself on every desktop it ships to.
 *
 * Path data is Lucide (MIT), inlined rather than linked: setup must render
 * fully offline, so there is no CDN, no icon font and no network request in
 * this file. Drawn on Lucide's grid - 24×24, 2px stroke, no fill, round caps
 * and joins - which is why they sit together as one set and why they take
 * their colour from whatever they are placed in.
