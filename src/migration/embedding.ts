/**
 * Re-embedding every entry after an embedding-model change.
 *
 * Switching models changes the vector dimensions, and a Vectorize index fixes
 * its dimensions at creation. So a model change means a new index, a redeploy
 * pointing the binding at it, and every entry re-embedded into it. The desktop
 * app drives that; this module is the part that runs inside the Worker.
 *
 * # D1 is never written destructively
 *
 * `entries.content` is the source of truth and migration only reads it. Vectors
 * are derived data. The worst outcome here is a rebuild that has to be re-run,
 * never a lost memory.
 *
 * # Why this keeps its own ledger
 *
 * The obvious progress marker is `entries.vector_ids`, the way
 * `POST /vectorize-pending` uses it — select the rows that still read `'[]'`.
 * That does not work here, and the reason is worth stating because it is not
 * obvious: vector ids are **deterministic**. `storeEntry` derives them from the
 * entry id and chunk count, so re-embedding unchanged content into a brand new
 * index produces byte-identical id strings. `vector_ids` was already non-empty
 * before the migration and stays non-empty throughout.
 *
 * An entry the migration never reached therefore reads as "vectorized" in D1
 * while the live index holds nothing for it. `/vectorize-pending` cannot see it,
 * `/stats.unvectorized` reports zero, and the dashboard's repair prompt stays
 * hidden. So this ledger in KV is not merely a convenience for resuming — it is
 * the only record of what has actually been rebuilt.
 *
 * # Why it stops rather than pushing on
 *
 * Embedding is the one operation with a daily budget. If that budget runs out
 * part-way, every remaining entry fails for the same reason, and a loop that
 * kept going would burn the rest of the run producing identical errors while
 * reporting hundreds of distinct "failures". So a batch that achieves nothing
 * stops the run and keeps its cursor. The user is told to resume later, and
 * resuming costs nothing already paid for.
