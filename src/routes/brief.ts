/**
 * GET /brief — what the brain did while you were away.
 *
 * The dashboard used to open on an empty screen with a text box, on a brain
 * holding thousands of memories that four nightly jobs had spent the night
 * compressing, linking and judging. Everything below is already-produced work
 * being read back; nothing here computes, embeds, or calls a model.
 *
 * BUDGET. Six D1 queries, no AI, no Vectorize, and one HTTP round trip
 * because the alternative — the client asking six endpoints — spends six of
 * the ~50 subrequests a free-plan invocation gets, on every app open. Each
 * query is either indexed (created_at DESC) or bounded by a small LIMIT. The
 * count is pinned by test/integration/brief-budget.test.ts, and that pin is
 * the point: this endpoint is the one thing every user runs every time.
