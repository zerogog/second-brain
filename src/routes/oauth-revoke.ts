/**
 * Disconnecting every AI tool (#235 §6).
 *
 * `AUTH_TOKEN` is the brain's password, but it is not the only credential that
 * opens a brain. Clients that came in through `/oauth/authorize` — Claude Code,
 * Cursor — hold tokens issued by `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` and stored
 * in `OAUTH_KV`. Those are validated against KV, never against `AUTH_TOKEN`, so
 * changing the password leaves them connected and working.
 *
 * That is the right behaviour for a routine password change and the wrong one
 * after a leak: whoever used the leaked password to complete an authorization
 * keeps access permanently. This route is the explicit way to close that door,
 * kept separate from rotation so neither action silently does the other's work.
 *
 * ## What actually has to be deleted
 *
 * Verified against `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider@0.8.2`
 * (`dist/oauth-provider.js`), which writes four families of key:
 *
 * - `grant:<userId>:<grantId>` — the authorization itself. Refresh tokens are
 *   *not* a separate key family: `refreshTokenId` / `previousRefreshTokenId`
 *   live inside this record, so deleting the grant kills the refresh tokens
 *   with it.
 * - `token:<userId>:<grantId>:<tokenId>` — access tokens. These must go too,
 *   and this is the part a grant-only implementation gets wrong: token
 *   validation (`handleApiRequest`) looks up the `token:` key and reads the
 *   client's props straight out of it. It never checks that the grant still
 *   exists. Delete only the grants and every live access token keeps working
 *   until it expires on its own.
 * - `client:<clientId>` — dynamic client registrations. Deliberately kept. A
 *   registration is an app's identity, not a credential for this brain: with no
 *   grant behind it, the client can do nothing but start a fresh authorization,
 *   which needs the password. Deleting it would instead make clients that
 *   cached their `client_id` fail with `invalid_client` rather than simply
 *   asking to reconnect — a worse experience for no security gain.
 * - `enterprise-jti:<hash>` — EMA replay markers, TTL'd. Not credentials.
 *   Deleting them would weaken replay protection, not strengthen anything.
 *
 * There is no separate user→grant index to clean up; the provider enumerates
 * grants with a prefix list, exactly as this route does.
 *
 * `OAUTH_KV` is shared with the rest of the Worker — `config:overrides`,
 * `migration:embedding`, `integrations:<provider>`. Wiping those would be a
 * data-loss bug far worse than the problem this solves, so the scan is
 * prefix-scoped and every key is re-checked before it is deleted.
