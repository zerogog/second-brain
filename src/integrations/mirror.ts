 * mirror sync sharing that invocation with room for nothing useful: five batches
 * cost 100 D1 queries on their own, and even one batch put the shared invocation
 * exactly at the cap — over it as soon as the batch was updates rather than
 * creates, or a second provider was connected (#290).
 *
 * So the sync runs on its own trigger with its own allowance. Must match the
 * second entry in wrangler.jsonc's `triggers.crons` exactly — scheduled() in
 * src/index.ts routes on it, and a mismatch would silently send this job's work
 * to the nightly invocation, which is the problem it exists to avoid.
 * test/unit/cron-triggers.test.ts fails if the two drift apart.
