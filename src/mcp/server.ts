// The read/write tool descriptions below are the only place this behaviour is

// classification on the model's behalf — the calling client already has the
// reasoning to judge results, retry a weak search, and decide append-vs-new, so
// the contract's job is to tell it how. Deliberately free of any assumption
// about what a particular brain contains: every filter a client is told to
// reach for comes from the user's own conversation or from metadata on a
// returned memory, never from a vocabulary baked in here.
const RECALL_DESCRIPTION =
  "Recall: semantically search your second brain for relevant notes and context. "
  + "Call recall automatically at the start of every conversation and every 3-4 messages.\n\n"
  + "EVALUATE, DON'T ASSUME. Ask for enough candidates to compare — topK 5 (the default) unless the task "
  + "justifies otherwise — then read the returned content and decide which memory actually answers the "
  + "question. Rank order and the (NN% match) figure are retrieval signals, not calibrated confidence that a "
  + "memory answers you: rank 1 is a candidate, not a guarantee.\n\n"
  + "RECOVER ONCE. If the results come back empty, off-topic, ambiguous, dominated by loosely related "
  + "memories, or missing something you expected to be there, make one more targeted recall before concluding "
  + "the information is not stored. Sharpen it with any of: a more specific query, the subject named "
  + "explicitly instead of a pronoun or a vague reference, tag, kind, after, before, hops.\n\n"
  + "CHOOSE ON FIT. Prefer the memory that most directly answers the question — not automatically the newest, "
  + "the highest-scoring, the longest, or a particular kind. All else equal: semantic memories are better for "
  + "durable facts, settled decisions, preferences, and current authoritative state; episodic memories are "
  + "better for a specific event, sequence, investigation, or point-in-time question; and a specific memory "
  + "that answers the question beats a broad summary that merely discusses the same topic. Kind and lifecycle "
  + "status are separate dimensions: among otherwise comparable memories a canonical one outranks a draft for "
  + "settled or authoritative information, but not when the question is precisely about what is tentative or "
  + "still being decided.\n\n"
  + "GRAPH. Raise hops to 1-2 when the question is about why something happened, how a decision evolved, "
  + "chronology, causes, outcomes, related decisions, or what came before or after something. Leave it at 0 "
  + "when direct matches already answer the question.\n\n"
  + "TRUNCATION. Long memories come back shortened to keep the response small: any result ending in a "
  + "[truncated …] marker is PARTIAL, so call get(id) before relying on its details or quoting it. Results "
  + "without that marker are complete.";

const GET_DESCRIPTION =
  "Get one memory in full by ID. recall and list_recent return bounded previews, and a result ending in a "
  + "[truncated …] marker is partial. Call get(id) before you answer, quote, or act on such a result whenever "
  + "the omitted part could materially change the answer — a fact, a number, a decision, a sequence, exact "
  + "wording, a status change, or a later update appended to the entry. You do not have to fetch every "
  + "truncated result, only the ones you are about to rely on. Get the ID from recall or list_recent.";

const CONNECTIONS_DESCRIPTION =
  "List the memories directly linked to a given entry (its 1-hop neighbors in the relationship graph). Use it "
  + "for targeted relationship exploration once recall has already identified a relevant memory and you need "
  + "what surrounds it: causal history, decision lineage, preceding or following developments, related events, "
  + "explicit links between memories. It returns an entry's neighbors regardless of your question, so it is "
  + "not a substitute for a sharper recall query — skip it when direct recall already answers the question. "
  + "Get the entry ID from recall or list_recent first.";

const REMEMBER_DESCRIPTION =
  "Store a distinct, durable idea, fact, decision, task, preference, event, or reusable observation in your "
  + "second brain. Call this automatically, without asking permission, whenever the user shares something "
  + "durable enough to be worth retrieving in a later conversation — a goal, a decision, a preference, a "
  + "commitment, a lasting piece of project or personal context. Passing conversational detail that will not "
  + "matter later does not need storing.\n\n"
  + "One memory per thing worth retrieving on its own. Before adding another memory about a subject you have "
  + "already stored, consider whether this is really an update to that memory: when it continues the same "
  + "thread — progress, a follow-up, a refinement, a later outcome — call append on the existing entry instead "
  + "of creating a near-duplicate.\n\n"
  + "VISIBILITY: on a team brain every memory lands in one of two layers. Personal = visible only to its "
  + "author. Company = visible to the whole team. If the user says \"share this\", \"the team should know\", "
  + "or similar, pass workspace: \"company\". If they say \"keep this private\", pass workspace: \"personal\". "
  + "With no workspace argument the member's configured default decides (personal unless their admin said "
  + "otherwise), so when policy matters to the user, be explicit. On a multi-team brain, call list_teams "
  + "first when the user wants something shared but has not named a team — present the team names and ask "
  + "which one if there is more than one, then pass that team's id as team. recall marks each result 'shared' or "
  + "'personal', and the share tool moves an existing memory between layers at any time. "
  + "Do not create a new durable memory for a repeated no-op observation, an "
  + "unchanged status, or a restatement of something already stored.\n\n"
  + "Do store separately when the information is genuinely its own retrieval target: a distinct event, a new "
  + "decision, a reusable insight, a task, an artifact, or anything you would later want to find on its own.";

const APPEND_DESCRIPTION =
  "Append new information to an existing memory. The original content is preserved and your addition is "
  + "stamped with today's date, so the entry keeps its history. Get the entry ID from recall or list_recent "
  + "first.\n\n"
  + "Use append for the continuing thread of a subject already stored: evolving project or task state, a "
  + "follow-up event, a later outcome attached to the original subject, a decision being refined, an ongoing "
  + "investigation, or recurring monitoring where something meaningfully changed. Prefer append over remember "
  + "whenever a new memory would substantially duplicate an existing continuing one.\n\n"
  + "Do not append unrelated information merely to avoid creating a new entry — if it is its own retrieval "
  + "target, call remember. To replace content that is simply no longer correct, use update.";

const UPDATE_DESCRIPTION =
  "Replace the full content of an existing memory. Use it when the prior content is no longer the correct "
  + "representation — a preference reversed, a decision overturned, a fact superseded. It is not the mechanism "
  + "for incremental history: use append when the earlier content still stands and you are adding to it. Get "
  + "the entry ID from recall or list_recent first.";

const LIST_RECENT_DESCRIPTION =
  "list_recent: List the most recent entries by date from your second brain. Use it to browse recent activity "
  + "or to locate an entry by time. It returns entries by recency, not by semantic relevance — when you want "
  + "memories that match a meaning, use recall. Long entries are shortened: a result ending in a [truncated …] "
  + "marker is PARTIAL, so call get(id) for its full text. "
  + "Pass actor to list only what one person wrote — their name as shown in the header, their user id, or \"me\". "
  + "Pass team (id from list_teams) with workspace:\"company\" to browse one team's shared layer.";

const LIST_TEAMS_DESCRIPTION =
  "List the shared teams you belong to, with display names and workspace ids. Call this before remember or "
  + "share with workspace:\"company\" when the user has not named a team — especially when more than one team "
  + "is returned. Present the names to the user and ask which team they mean when it matters. Use the id "
  + "(not the display name) as the team parameter on remember, share, recall, and list_recent.";

const SHARE_DESCRIPTION =
  "Move a memory between your private workspace and a shared team workspace. MOVE semantics: one canonical row; "
  + "edges follow it; audited. Only the entry's author or an admin can un-share. Call list_teams first when "
  + "sharing to company and the user has not named a team. Get the entry ID from recall or list_recent first.";
