/**
 * Model for `reasonOverPair` (src/insight/reason.ts) only — every other call
 * (classification, contradiction detection, smart merge, digests, recall
 * synthesis) keeps using `LLM_MODEL` above. Insight reasoning is a harder
 * judgment task than any of those: it has to read two memories written
 * months apart and decide whether there is a real, specific tension or
 * connection between them, not just extract or summarize. That deserves a
 * stronger model, but repointing the shared `LLM_MODEL` would change cost
 * and behaviour for five unrelated features for every user, so this is a
 * separate setting instead.
 *
 * Cost, worked from Cloudflare's published Workers AI neuron pricing (one
 * neuron per ~$0.011, at time of writing):
 *
 *   - LLM_MODEL default, @cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct:
 *     24,545 neurons/M input tokens, 77,273 neurons/M output tokens.
 *   - @cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b: 31,818 neurons/M input, 68,182 neurons/M output.
 *
 * gpt-oss-120b costs MORE per input token and LESS per output token. This
 * pass's shape (~550 input tokens, 200 output tokens per candidate, from the
 * ENTRY_EXCERPT_CHARS-bounded prompt in reason.ts) is output-light, so the
 * two effects mostly cancel:
 *
 *   scout:   550 * 24545/1e6 + 200 * 77273/1e6 ≈ 13.5 + 15.5 ≈ 29.0 neurons
 *   gpt-oss: 550 * 31818/1e6 + 200 * 68182/1e6 ≈ 17.5 + 13.6 ≈ 31.1 neurons
 *
 * ~7% more neurons for a model with roughly seven times the parameters. The
 * weekly pass reasons over at most WEEKLY_CANDIDATE_LIMIT (10) candidates —
 * see src/insight/weekly.ts — so a full week costs ~311 neurons, about 0.44%
 * of the 10,000-neuron/day free allocation. Re-derive rather than trust this
 * if either model's price or `ENTRY_EXCERPT_CHARS` / `INSIGHT_PASS_MAX_TOKENS`
 * below change.
