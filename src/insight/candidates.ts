/**
 * Nightly candidate accrual.
 *
 * Search and reasoning are split because coverage, not token cost, is what
 * binds. A weekly job gets ~50 D1 subrequests, which buys about 25 Vectorize
 * seeds — 97 weeks to cross a 1,940-entry brain once. Accruing nightly from the
 * entries just written turns that into continuous coverage, and new entries are
 * where new tension appears: a memory written today is the one most likely to
 * contradict or extend something from March.
 *
 * Nothing here re-embeds. Vectors were written at capture time; this reads them.
 *
 * Neighbour dates, tags, content and importance come from D1, not Vectorize
 * metadata. Metadata is stamped when the vector is *written*, not when the
 * entry was created — an append re-embeds with `Date.now()` (see
 * src/capture/store.ts) — so an old memory that was touched recently would
 * report a false-recent date under metadata and fail the gap floor, silently
 * dropping exactly the long-lived entries most likely to have drifted.
 * `entries.created_at` is never rewritten after capture, so it is the only
 * value trusted for the gap, the eligibility check, and the importance term
 * `scoreCandidate` uses.
