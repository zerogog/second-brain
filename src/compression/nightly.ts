 * How many tags one nightly run may compress.

 * This bound is what keeps the cron inside a free-plan invocation, and it is protecting
 * two independent ceilings, not one — raising it needs both re-measured:
 *
 *   - D1 subrequests. All four nightly jobs share a single scheduled() invocation and
 *     therefore one budget. Each compressed tag costs about six.
 *   - CPU. Cron Triggers get 10 ms on the free plan, and the work per tag is linear:
 *     measured 1.6 ms at 7 tags, 9.6 ms at 30, 20.2 ms at 60.
 *
 * Nothing bounded this before: every tag with more than ten eligible entries was
 * compressed on every run, so both costs grew with how many distinct tags a user had.
