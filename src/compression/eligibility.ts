/**
 * Tags the system writes ABOUT an entry, as opposed to tags describing what it is about.
 *
 * They are never digest candidates, and getting that wrong is not merely a wasted check:
 * a nightly run compresses at most COMPRESSION_MAX_TAGS_PER_RUN tags, chosen by descending
 * entry count, so a reserved tag in the candidate list takes a slot a real topic would have
 * had. These tags are applied in bulk — the staleness pass alone writes volatility: and
 * stale:as-of across up to 25 entries a night — so they outrank ordinary topics easily, and
 * the symptom is compression appearing to stop working with nothing in the logs to say why.
 *
 * Derived from the prefixes themselves so the SQL below, the guard in compressTag, and the
 * test double all agree by construction rather than by three copies staying in step.
 *
 * MATCHING IS CASE-INSENSITIVE, deliberately, and this is the dangerous half to get wrong.
 * compressTag selects the entries it will roll up with `tags LIKE '%"<tag>"%'`, and SQLite's
 * LIKE ignores ASCII case — so a candidate tag `Kind:Semantic` does not select the entries
 * carrying `Kind:Semantic`, it selects every entry carrying `kind:semantic` in any case.
 * Admitting one mixed-case reserved tag therefore does not cost a digest slot, it rolls up
 * whatever unrelated entries happen to share the lowercase system tag: content permanently
 * appended to, recall penalised, and the entries dropped from staleness, future compression
 * and /stats. Nothing lowercases the tags src/integrations/mirror.ts inserts, so this is
 * reachable, and it was reproduced: 9 entries tagged `holiday-plans` rolled up by a
 * candidate tag they never carried.
 *
 * The two directions are not symmetric. Wrongly reserving a user's `Status:Active` costs one
 * tag that never gets a digest. Wrongly admitting it costs up to 50 memories, irreversibly.
