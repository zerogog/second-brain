 * an append and drops it on a replacement (see capture/store.ts).
 *
 * Stripping it here would also make the verdict depend on how a memory was edited rather
 * than on what it says: the same fact would be classified or not according to whether the
 * user appended to it, a distinction the user never made. Recovery is not prompt either,
 * because the pass reconsiders a row only once it has gone untouched past the age gate,
