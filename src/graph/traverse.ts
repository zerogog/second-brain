// D1 queries for N nodes, plus one KV read for the config. At N=1500 that is
// 1 + 15 + 30 = 46, or 47 with the KV read. N=1600 lands on exactly 50 with
// nothing spare, and anything from 1634 up exceeds it outright — which would be
// a deterministically dead graph tab for every free-plan brain that large, and
// runGraphPass backfills edges nightly, so a brain arrives there on its own.
//
// That formula is the IDENTITY-LESS arithmetic — the cron callers. A scoped
// caller costs more, and it always did: the scope bindings share each
// statement's 100-parameter budget with the ids, so the batches shrink and the
// batch COUNT rises. Measured at N=1500 by counting D1 calls (a batch counts
// once, as the platform charges it):
//
//   identity-less                                    46
//   member, any view — personal, company or both     48
//   admin (reads the legacy '' layer too)            49
//
// Layer and author cost NOTHING on top of that: workspace_id and actor_id ride
// in the hydration's projection and the author's name arrives through a LEFT
// JOIN on it, so there is no per-view statement and no per-author bound
// parameter. A whole served request adds the identity batch and the KV config
// read: 50 for a member at N=1500, the entire free-plan budget with nothing
// spare. THAT TOTAL IS PINNED by "costs exactly this many subrequests at
// GRAPH_VIEW_MAX_NODES" in test/integration/graph-team-aware.test.ts — change it
// deliberately or not at all, and remember a cold isolate still pays
// initializeDatabase's DDL on top (#282).
//
// 47 is the WARM figure for the identity-less path. On a cold isolate the
// budget is shared with initializeDatabase, which fires under waitUntil and spends about 12 more on
// its DDL, so the first request against a fresh isolate costs ~59 and is over
// the limit — 1500 buys margin on the warm path, it does not clear the cold one.
// That is #282 (probe sqlite_master once instead of issuing twelve blind
// statements, taking cold /graph from 59 to 48), not something a lower cap here
// can fix: the tax is fixed, so it eats any N.
//
// Recompute the formula above before raising this, and count the cold case as
// well as the warm one. D1's 5M rows/day cap is the secondary bound and is
// nowhere near binding here; sizing against it is what produced a number that
// broke the free plan.
//
// It is a legibility limit too: the packed-cluster canvas is unreadable well
// before 1500 nodes.
