/**
 * Workspace rotation for the nightly maintenance passes (v3 Team Edition).
 *
 * Free-plan Workers allow ~50 D1 queries per invocation and the nightly passes already
 * spend ~30 of them on a single-user brain. Scanning the whole corpus per night grows
 * linearly with workspaces, so instead each invocation processes ONE workspace's slice
 * behind this round-robin cursor, keeping per-invocation cost roughly flat as teams grow.
 * The trade-off is coverage latency: the whole deployment cycles every K nights, where
 * K is the number of workspaces. Paid plans fit every workspace in one run anyway; the
 * cursor advancing each night costs them nothing but three cheap queries.
 *
 * LEGACY RULE: '' — the pre-team space every v2 brain lived in — participates in the
 * ring like any other value (it sorts first), so upgraded brains keep being processed
 * every cycle rather than falling out of maintenance at the migration boundary.
 *
 * Ring semantics: lexicographically ascending over the DISTINCT workspace_ids present
 * in `entries`, starting strictly AFTER the stored cursor value and wrapping to the
 * smallest when the cursor is at or past the maximum. The seeded cursor value is '',
 * so on a fresh ring the first nights process the named workspaces and '' gets its
 * turn at the wrap-around — one turn per cycle, same as everyone else.
 *
 * Race tolerance: two isolates firing together can both read the same cursor and both
 * advance it; the worst case is both processing the same slice, which is harmless
 * because these passes are idempotent. No CAS is worth adding for that.
 *
 * Returns NULL when the corpus has no workspaces at all (nothing to process), and also
 * on any read failure — callers then behave as they did pre-v3 and scan the whole
 * corpus, which degrades to the old cost rather than skipping maintenance entirely.
