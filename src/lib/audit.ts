 * is that caller: it exists because a per-id loop puts a ceiling on the batch
 * size (a free-plan invocation gets roughly 50 D1 queries), and its cost is
 * pinned flat in the number of ids in test/integration/patterns.test.ts. A
 * per-id audit write would have reintroduced exactly the ceiling the route was
 * built to remove.

 * already been committed to D1, the exact thing fire-and-forget exists to make

 * a promise would move the throwing part back to the call site, which is
