 * MCP twins of these routes behave, since zod rejects a non-integer outright.
 * `after` and `before` have no default to fall back to either — defaulting them
 * would drop the filter and answer with more rows than were asked for, which is
 * wrong data wearing a 200, the one failure a caller cannot detect.
 *
 * Out of range is still clamped, not rejected: `?n=200` means "as many as
 * you'll give me" and has always been answered with 100.
 *
 * Only an absent parameter gets the default. A present one must parse, and that
 * includes the empty forms `?after=` and `?after` — for the same reason as
 * above, since defaulting them drops the filter. It also means `?n=$UNSET` from
 * a shell says so instead of quietly becoming 20. This is a deliberate
 * divergence from the string parameters beside these, where `?tag=` reads as
 * absent: an empty tag filter has one obvious meaning, an empty timestamp does
 * not.
 *
 * Used as `const n = intParam(url, "n", …); if (n instanceof Response) return n;`
 * — the same early-return shape as requireAuth above.
