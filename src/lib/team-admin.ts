 *
 * 1. The columns are named POSITIVELY. It is a three-column SELECT, not
 *    `u.*` with fields deleted afterwards — so a column added to `users`
 *    tomorrow (the next `lastUsedAt`) cannot appear here by default. Widening
 *    this list has to be a deliberate edit to this line, which is what
 *    test/integration/team-roster.test.ts's exhaustive key assertion pins.
 * 2. The set of PEOPLE is scoped through `memberships` to the workspace ids on
 *    the caller's resolved identity — never a bare `FROM users`. Constraint 1
 *    applies to people as much as to memories: on a deployment with two company
 *    workspaces, this join is the thing that stops one team's roster reaching
 *    the other.
 *
 * Suspended members are omitted rather than flagged. A suspended member cannot
 * authenticate, so they are not someone you can share with; and publishing the
 * flag would publish an employment fact only an admin has business knowing.
 * Admins keep the full picture — suspension included — through GET /team/members.
 *
 * DISTINCT because a colleague in two of the caller's teams is two membership
 * rows and one person.
 *
 * COLLATE NOCASE on the sort because SQLite's default BINARY collation orders
 * every uppercase letter before every lowercase one, so "alice" would come
 * after "Zoe" and a team with mixed-case names would read as unsorted. `u.id`
 * stays as the tiebreaker so two people with the same name still have a stable
