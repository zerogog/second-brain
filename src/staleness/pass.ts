 * One round of writes as a single subrequest, keeping the per-row path as a fallback.

 * All four nightly jobs fire from one scheduled() invocation and share its budget (#278),
 * and at one UPDATE per candidate, plus retries, plus cursor advances, this pass was the
 * largest consumer of it. A batch costs one subrequest whatever it carries.
 *
 * batch() is atomic, and the two ways a statement can come back have to be told apart. A
 * CAS that loses reports changes: 0 and does not roll the batch back (verified against
 * workerd, not assumed), so contention is free here. A genuine SQL error does roll back
 * everything, which would leave up to 25 inspected rows with a NULL cursor sitting at the
 * front of the next run's queue, so a rejected batch replays per row: the behaviour this
 * replaced, at the cost it used to pay, on the path that used to be the only path.
 *
 * That fallback is deliberately not free. If every batch is rejected AND every per-row
 * replay also fails, the pass degenerates to about 107 subrequests, 1 candidate query,
 * then a rejected batch plus 25 replays on each of three attempts and again on the cursor
 * advance. That is well over the free plan's 50, but it only happens when D1 is refusing
 * writes outright, and a pass that spends the budget failing is strictly better than one
 * that abandons 25 rows with NULL cursors for every later run to trip over.
