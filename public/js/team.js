 *
 * WHEN IT LOCKS is decided by real membership rather than by the flag.
 * teamMembers comes from GET /team/members, which already excludes tombstoned
 * rows, so `> 1` is the same headcount PATCH /config refuses the write on —
 * and reading it here rather than TEAM_MODE covers the ordering hole
 * maybeRevealTeamInsights documents: TEAM_MODE is assigned off a /health probe

 * via registerProtocolHandler) gets this rewritten by the browser into a real
 * navigation — `https://mail.google.com/…?url=mailto%3A…` — which lands the

 * which is an insecure channel regardless — the token sits in the
 * recipient's inbox and the sender's Sent folder no matter what this
 * function does. The webmail-handler path adds history and a provider log
 * on top of a risk the admin already accepted; stripping the token from the
 * email would leave an invite nobody can act on, which defeats the feature.
