// ── The destructive-action sheet ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One `#confirm-dialog` in the page, parameterised by its caller. Memory
// delete used to own it privately; every other irreversible action asked with
// `confirm()`, which the browser styles, cannot translate beyond its own UI
// language, and cannot say "and also throw the data away" without asking a
// second question. A second sheet would have solved that and then diverged
// from this one the first time either was restyled, so there is exactly one,
// and memory delete is now just its first caller.
//
// Two hazards come with replacing a modal browser dialog with one reused
// element, and both are handled here rather than left to each caller:
//
//   1. IDENTITY. `confirm()` was one dialog per call. Here a slow action whose
//      sheet has since been dismissed and replaced would otherwise close — and
//      reset the state behind — whatever question is on screen now. So an
//      action is not given a way to say "close the sheet"; it is given a
//      handle that can only close ITS OWN question, and does nothing once that
//      question has been superseded. The identity comes out of lexical scope,
//      which is the only thing that survives two actions being in flight at
//      once. Anything the module remembered about "which action is running"
//      would be ambient state, and two overlapping actions corrupt it.
//   2. DOUBLE SUBMIT. `confirm()` blocked the page, so it could not be
//      answered twice. An accept button can be tapped twice, and two POSTs go
//      out. `runConfirmAction` holds the button down for the duration.
//
// Depends on nothing but the DOM; `toast.js` loads before it only so callers
// can report failure from inside their own action.
