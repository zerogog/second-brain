/**
 * `GET /health`'s `team` flag — the dashboard's only signal for "show the
 * layer controls".
 *
 * The subject is the COUNT that flag is derived from, so this runs against
 * real SQLite rather than the string-matching D1 double: the bug it pins was a
 * missing WHERE clause, and a double that answers a canned row for
 * `SELECT COUNT(*) ... FROM users` cannot tell the two queries apart.
 *
 * `removeMember` does not delete the `users` row — it deletes the member's
 * entries, edges, memberships and personal workspace and then tombstones the
 * row (`removed_at`), so shared memories the person wrote stay attributable to
 * a name. A bare `COUNT(*) FROM users` therefore counts people who are gone,
 * and a brain that ever had a second member could never read as solo again.
