 * One AI mock that answers differently per candidate, keyed off the "tier N"
 * token each fixture's content carries — the same trick
 * insight-cron-budget.test.ts uses for the same reason: a single canned
 * response can't tell an ordering test apart from a lucky coincidence.
 * `declineTier` is the one candidate that gets refused; everything else is
 * accepted with text that shares vocabulary with its own pair (required by
 * reasonOverPair's sharesVocabulary floor).
 *
 * Each accepted tier's text is genuinely distinct wording, not a shared
 * template with the tier digit swapped in. Before this task, the dry-run
 * endpoint never called restatesRecent, so a digit-swapped template worked
 * here by accident. distinctiveTokens (reason.ts) drops a bare digit
 * entirely — it only matches tokens starting with a letter — so a
 * template that differs solely by "tier N" is ~100% token-identical across
 * every tier once tokenised, and now that the dry run applies D2 the same
 * way the weekly pass does, that template would make every candidate after
 * the first report as restating the one before it, which is correct
 * behaviour, not a bug, but would defeat this test's premise of exercising
 * cap-based ordering rather than restatement suppression. Matches the same
 * fix test/unit/insight-weekly.test.ts's own "reasons over the
 * highest-scored candidates first" test needed for the identical reason.
