/**
 * #281 — the dashboard graph view must not read the whole edges table.
 *
 * Driven against real SQLite (`test/helpers/sqlite-d1.ts`) rather than the string-matching
 * D1 mock, because the bug *is* the query plan. The mock slices a sorted array, so it
 * hands back exactly the right rows whether or not SQLite could have found them without
 * scanning and sorting every edge first — it cannot fail on this.
 *
 * What the plan costs, measured on workerd D1 through Miniflare (`meta.rows_read`):
 *
 *   edges     query                             before    after
 *   50,000    ORDER BY weight DESC LIMIT 6000   100,000   6,000
 *   200,000   ORDER BY weight DESC LIMIT 6000   400,000   6,000
 *   200,000   ORDER BY weight DESC (no LIMIT)   400,000   200,000
 *   200,000   one whole GET /graph              1,499,398 38,598
 *
 * Two separate things go wrong, and the middle rows are what separate them. Without an
 * index on weight there is no ordered path to it, so SQLite reads every row into a temp
 * b-tree and applies the LIMIT afterwards — rows_read is 2x the edge count and the LIMIT
 * buys nothing. With the index but no LIMIT the sort is gone, but the scan still runs to
 * the end of the table. Only index *and* LIMIT together bound the read, which is why the
 * cap in buildGraph is part of this fix rather than a separate tidy-up. D1's free plan
 * allows 5M rows read per day and fails every query account-wide until 00:00 UTC once that
 * is spent: three /graph requests at 200k edges, and fewer as the brain grows.
 *
 * node:sqlite exposes no step counters, so the assertions stand on the plan instead:
 * "USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY" is SQLite stating it must materialise and sort every row
 * before the LIMIT can apply, which is precisely the 2x-edge-count reads above, while an
 * index scan feeding a LIMIT stops after LIMIT rows. The plan is asserted on the exact SQL
 * `buildGraph` issues, captured from the binding rather than restated here, so it cannot
 * drift into testing a query the Worker does not run.
