/**
 * A graph walk may not travel THROUGH a memory the caller cannot read.
 *
 * `expandGraph` scoped its `edges` scan but not the endpoints it derived from it:
 * every id on the far side of a readable edge became a candidate, whether or not
 * the `entries` row behind it was in the caller's readable set. No content leaked
 * — `getConnections` drops rows `hydrateGraphEntries` did not return, `buildGraph`
 * filters against its node set, and recall hydrates through a scoped query — so
 * hop 1 looked safe. Hop 2 was not: an unreadable node still entered the frontier,
 * and the walk continued out the other side of it. The result is a node set that
 * depends on a colleague's private memory. The reached node may itself be
 * perfectly readable; the *path* to it is the thing the caller was never entitled
 * to, and the edge structure it implies is inference drawn from a private row.
 *
 * Cross-layer edges are not hypothetical after Task 10 refuses new ones:
 *   - `moveEntry` re-stamps every edge the moved entry is an endpoint of, so
 *     sharing one end of a link made before the share moves the EDGE into the
 *     company layer and leaves the far end personal. That is the "link then share" case below, driven
 *     through the real /link and /share routes rather than seeded.
 *   - `inferEdgesOnWrite` copies the SOURCE entry's workspace, so a company-layer
 *     capture whose nearest neighbour is someone's private memory writes a
 *     company-stamped edge to a personal row, with no explicit link involved.
 *
 * Real SQLite, because the subject is whether a scope clause hides a row.
