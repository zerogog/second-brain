 * POST /insights/accrue — run one accrual pass on demand, and report what

 *
 * The nightly cron (runInsightAccrual, src/insight/candidates.ts) examines
 * only ACCRUAL_SEED_LIMIT (25) entries a run, so a self-hoster installing
 * this against an existing brain of a few thousand entries would otherwise
 * wait months for the backfill cursor to cross it once. This endpoint exists
 * so priming a large brain is something a user can actually do — call it
 * repeatedly and watch `seeds_examined` and `candidates_recorded` move.
 * These tests assert it reuses runInsightAccrual rather than reimplementing
 * it (same cursor, same eligibility rules), reports real counts rather than
 * a bare `ok: true`, and is gated behind the same auth every other admin
 * route uses.
