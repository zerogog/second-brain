/**
 * GET /team/activity — the compliance feed.
 *
 * admin_events has recorded every team administration action since Phase 1 and
 * nothing has ever read a row of it. This is the reader, and these are the
 * properties that make it a trail rather than a list:
 *
 *  - ORDERING and PAGING across BOTH trails. The route issues one compound
 *    statement precisely so LIMIT/OFFSET applies to the merged order. Two
 *    independently-paged selects stitched together in JavaScript pass a
 *    "rows come back" test and silently drop rows the moment one trail is
 *    busier than the other, so the interleave case below is written to fail
 *    against that implementation specifically.
 *  - SCOPE on the memory arm, AT THE ROW. requireAdmin authorises a SURFACE; it
 *    never widens which memory rows a caller may read. An event naming a memory
 *    the caller cannot read is not in the feed at all — not its text, not its
 *    id, not its actor, not the workspace id in its detail. A row hidden in one
 *    column and disclosed in three others is not scoped, which is why the
 *    second-company block below exists: every same-company case passes with the
 *    predicate on either side of the join and so can never tell the two apart.
 *  - NAMES, never ids, in `actor` and `subject` — including for the two events
 *    an auditor most needs, member_suspended and member_removed, whose subjects
 *    are exactly the people listRoster deliberately hides. Two states only:
 *    a name or null, never "".
 *
 * Timestamps are driven by a stubbed clock, so "newest first" is a fact rather
 * than a coin toss. The one place ties are deliberate is the tied-timestamp
 * paging case, which is what production actually produces — a bulk resolve
 * stamps ~97 rows with one Date.now().
