/**
 * #288 — recall must not scan the tag table on every call.
 *
 * `SELECT DISTINCT value FROM entries, json_each(entries.tags) ORDER BY value` is a
 * full table scan expanded once per tag per row, and `inferQueryTags` ran it on
 * every recall. Measured on workerd D1 through Miniflare (`meta.rows_read`), one
 * `recallEntries({ query, topK: 5 })` at four tags an entry:
 *
 *   entries   tag scan   whole recall   whole recall    GET /tags   recalls/day
 *                            (before)        (after)   before→after   before→after
 *   1,000        9,000         11,000          2,000     9,000 → 0     454 → 2,500
 *   5,000       45,000         55,000         10,000    45,000 → 0      90 →   500
 *   20,000     180,000        220,000         40,000   180,000 → 0      22 →   125
 *
 * D1's free plan allows 5M rows read per day and fails every query on the account
 * until 00:00 UTC once that is spent. The scan was 82% of a recall, and the MCP
 * clients this project ships instructions for recall at the start of every
 * conversation and every few messages after — so 90 a day on a 5,000-memory brain
 * was ordinary use, not a stress test.
 *
 * No rewrite makes that query sub-linear — every variant plans identically on real
 * SQLite (`SCAN entries`, `SCAN json_each`, temp b-tree, with or without ORDER BY, as
 * a GROUP BY, with a LIMIT, with an index on `tags`) — so the tests below are about
 * the query *not running*, and about every way it can fail to run costing a boost
 * rather than a result.
 *
 * The rebuild that remains does drop `ORDER BY value` and sort in JS, which is 44%
 * off its rows read for identical output (5,000 entries: 45,000 → 25,000; 20,000:
 * 180,000 → 100,000). Identical plans, different costs: the DISTINCT b-tree has to be
 * walked back out to emit in order. `orders the vocabulary identically to the SQL it
 * replaced` below is what keeps that honest.
 *
 * Driven against real SQLite (`test/helpers/sqlite-d1.ts`) with every statement
 * recorded, because what is under test is which statements are issued.
