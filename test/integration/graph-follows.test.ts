/**
 * B2 — typing the one relationship capture already knows about.
 *
 * Two episodic memories written minutes apart are usually one train of thought,
 * and `relates_to` throws that away. The ordering is already in `created_at` and
 * the kinds are already in the tags the classifier writes, so `follows` costs no
 * model call — only the decision to record what is known.
 *
 * Driven against real SQLite: the pair-level DELETE behind typed-replaces-
 * generic and the `kind:` tag parsing are both things the string-matching D1
 * mock only approximates.
 *
 * The burst guard is the part worth arguing with. Importing a week of notes, or
 * a transcript splitting into many chunks, writes a dozen episodic entries in
 * one minute; each would "follow" the last, and the chain would be an artefact
 * of the write, not of the thinking. So `follows` is emitted only when exactly
 * one neighbour qualifies — a claim about a specific predecessor, or nothing.
