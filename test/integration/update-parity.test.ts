/**
 * POST /update and the MCP `update` tool must leave the database in the SAME state.
 *
 * They were two implementations of one operation, and the MCP copy — the path every
 * assistant client actually calls — quietly drifted (#289): it committed content against
 * stale vectors when an embed failed, never moved updated_at, never reset the staleness
 * tags, and never extracted hashtags. Every one of those is invisible from the
 * MCP side alone; each only reads as a bug next to what the route does with the same
 * input. Nothing compared them, so nothing failed.
 *
 * So this suite does not assert what update *should* write. It runs each scenario through
 * both callers against the same starting row and asserts the resulting rows and vectors are
 * identical — then, separately, pins the handful of facts that both must satisfy so a
 * change that breaks them in both places is still caught. Add a scenario to CASES and both
 * callers are covered by construction.
 *
 * Real workerd D1 through Miniflare, not test/helpers/d1-mock. The mock matches query
 * strings, so it cannot tell a row that was written from one that was not — which is
 * exactly the distinction the fail-closed path turns on — and it has diverged from
 * production in this repo before, in both directions.
