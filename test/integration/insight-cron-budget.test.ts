  /**
   * THE CHUNKED ARM, measured rather than inferred.
   *
   * 47 above is one company workspace, so the slice fits one statement and the
   * second chunk never executes. weekly.ts's own comment reasons from it to
   * "two statements is 48 of 50 at the very worst" — which is exactly the
   * "pass + 2 is a calculation nothing checks" this file objects to elsewhere.
   * So it is driven end to end through scheduled(), at the two workspace
   * counts that bracket the behaviour:
   *
   *   49 workspaces — 2N + 1 = 99 parameters, still ONE statement, still 47.
   *   50 workspaces — 101 parameters unchunked, so the second statement is
   *                   owed and the invocation costs 48.
   *   98 workspaces — the whole capacity (MAX_SLICE_STATEMENTS chunks). Still
   *                   48: a third statement is never issued, which is what
   *                   MAX_SLICE_STATEMENTS is for.
   *
   * The slate lives in the LAST workspace of the slice on purpose, so the
   * measured run is one where the second chunk is the chunk that does the
   * work, not one where it comes back empty.
