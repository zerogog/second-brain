/**
 * Caller-count drift guards for the destructive-action sheet's two entry
 * points, held equal to what the architecture doc says.
 *
 * `docs/dashboard-architecture.md` enumerates the callers of both
 * `openDangerConfirm` and `closeConfirm` and makes a claim about each set:
 * that every `openDangerConfirm` caller closes with its own `done()`, and that
 * every `closeConfirm` caller is ambient. Those properties are the whole point
 * of the split between the two. The prose has gone stale three times because
 * someone added a caller and the count next to it did not move.
 *
 * Neither guard knows whether a NEW caller obeys the rule — that still needs a
 * human read against the doc — but both know how many callers there are, and
 * fail loudly the moment that number changes so the doc can't just be
 * forgotten.
 *
 * If one of these starts failing after you added a call: update the count in
 * `docs/dashboard-architecture.md` and `EXPECTED` below, and — the part a count
 * cannot check for you — confirm the new caller obeys the rule for that entry
 * point.
 *
 * WHY THE SCAN IS A DIRECTORY WALK AND NOT A LIST
 *
 * This started as a hardcoded six-file allowlist while its own failure message
 * claimed it covered `public/`. It did not: 20 of the 25 files in `public/js`
 * were never opened, including `coach.js`, which the phase that wrote the
 * allowlist added. An allowlist is the wrong shape for a drift guard, because
 * the drift it is least able to see is a call from a file nobody thought to
 * list — which is the same failure mode as having no guard at all. So it walks
 * the tree, and asserts below that the walk actually found the tree.
