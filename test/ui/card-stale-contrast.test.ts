/**
 * The stale-card modifier must not reduce text contrast on the card.
 *
 * This file used to open by recording that --text-tertiary was BELOW WCAG AA on
 * --bg-card in both themes — 4.4987 dark, 3.0457 light — and reasoned from there
 * that no tint could help, since lightening pushed dark further down and
 * darkening pushed light down instead. It pinned those two numbers precisely and
 * said: "if a theme change ever buys headroom, this test fails and the tint ban
 * can be reconsidered."
 *
 * A theme change bought the headroom. The ink ramp moved so all three steps clear
 * AA on every surface they are set on, and these assertions are now the other way
 * round: both baselines PASS, and the test's job is to stop them regressing.
 *
 * The tint ban stays, on its first reason rather than its second: card--stale
 * signals with a dashed border because that is how the other card modifiers work
 * — card--synthesized varies border colour, card--rolled-up varies opacity,
 * neither touches the background.
 *
 * This encodes the rule rather than the current declaration, so a re-added tint is
 * caught by the number that matters — including via background-color, background-image,
 * or a theme-scoped override, which a check keyed on the literal `background:` missed.
