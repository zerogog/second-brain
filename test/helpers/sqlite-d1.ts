/**
 * A D1 facade over real SQLite, for tests whose subject is the SQL itself.
 *
 * `test/helpers/d1-mock.ts` matches query strings and returns canned rows. That
 * is the right tool for most tests — it is fast and it keeps fixtures obvious —
 * but it cannot evaluate SQL, so anything whose correctness *is* the query is
 * untestable against it. The embedding migration is exactly that: a keyset
 * cursor whose comparison decides whether entries are skipped or repeated, and
 * an aggregate that projects chunk counts with integer division.
 *
 * D1 is SQLite, and `node:sqlite` ships with Node, so those queries can be run
 * for real against the project's own `db/schema.sql`. A wrong comparison then
 * fails the test instead of passing a string match.
 *
 * The schema migration in `src/db/init.ts` is the other case, and the sharper
 * one: `d1-mock`'s `exec()` is a no-op, so it cannot express "that column is
 * already there" or "that table is not" — the two facts the migration now reads
 * before it writes. Against real SQLite a probe that misreports an empty
 * database as migrated leaves the tables uncreated and the next statement fails,
 * which is exactly the regression worth catching. Pass `{ schema: false }` for a
 * database with nothing in it at all.
 *
 * Only the surface the code under test uses is implemented — `prepare`, `bind`,
 * `all`, `first`, `run`, `exec`. Reach for `d1-mock` for everything else.
