// --- Vector construction -----------------------------------------------
//
// An earlier version of this fixture built vectors as sin(seed + i * 0.001)
// for a hand-picked seed per entry, on the theory that seeds close together
// (1, 1.0005, ...) would cosine-cluster and seeds far apart (1 vs 2 vs 3)
// would not. Measured, that is false: any two seeds within about half a
// sine cycle of one another collapse to near-identical vectors regardless
// of how far apart the seeds are — cosine(near(1), near(2)) came out to
// 0.992, as high as the deliberately-planted contradiction pair itself.
// Every "unrelated topic" pair the fixture was supposed to keep apart
// (pricing vs onboarding, pricing vs support) was accidentally a neighbour
// of everything else in the 1-3 range, and the near-duplicate decoy could
// not be built at all: making it dissimilar enough to the entry it was
// supposed to fail against necessarily made it just as dissimilar to the
// entry it was supposed to succeed against, because those two were
// themselves cosine-indistinguishable. See task-9-report.md.
//
// This replaces it with topic clusters: each cluster is an independent
// random unit vector, and each cluster's members blend that shared
// direction with their own independent noise. In 384 dimensions,
// independently-drawn random unit vectors have cosine similarity
// clustered tightly around 0 (concentration of measure), so distinct
// clusters separate reliably without hand-tuning, and a member's
// similarity to its own cluster is controlled directly by `pull`.
//
// A second, narrower version of the same mistake showed up within the
// pricing cluster itself, after this fix: at the cluster default (0.92
// pull), plant-contradiction-old and plant-contradiction-new measured
// 0.9920 — so close that no third vector could be built similar to one and
// dissimilar to the other, which is exactly what decoy-recent needs (see
// its comment below). `PRICING_PULL` loosens that one cluster to ~0.87
// pairwise, leaving room underneath for the decoy without touching anything
// else. See task-9-report.md's second entry for the measured before/after.
