/**
 * entries.updated_at nullability guard.
 *
 * The column is added by a runtime ALTER (src/db/init.ts) and is deliberately never
 * backfilled, so every row that predates the staleness feature reads NULL forever. That
 * is safe only while every reader coalesces it to created_at — a reader that stops is
 * not a type error and not a test failure anywhere else, it just silently misbehaves on
 * old memories. `ORDER BY updated_at DESC` is the sharp edge: SQLite sorts NULL first,
 * so descending order puts every never-updated row last, behind rows from 1970.
 *
 * So this classifies every occurrence of the column by its syntactic position rather
 * than pattern-matching whole statements — a substring allow-list exempts the entire
 * literal, which lets a raw read ride along inside an otherwise-legitimate write.
 *
 * Scope is src/. The dashboard (public/js/) reads updated_at only from API responses,
 * which are already coalesced server-side by the rules enforced here.
