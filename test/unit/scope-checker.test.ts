/**
 * The house rule in `src/lib/scope.ts`, "no unscoped corpus-wide query", was
 * enforced by review and by the isolation suite alone, and both let three
 * queries through (see the commit that scoped GET /insights/dry-run and GET
 * /stats). `scripts/check-scope.mjs` is the mechanical half. This file is the
 * checker's own test: a checker that silently matches nothing would pass CI
 * forever while enforcing nothing at all.
 *
 * There is no ESLint in this repo, so the checker is a plain Node script and
 * these cases drive its exported `scanSource` directly, plus one that runs the
 * real CLI over the real `src/`.

  // THE COUNTS ARE PINNED, and that is the point of this test rather than a
  // sanity check.
  //
  // Two evasions were found in this checker whose defining property was that
  // the SUMMARY DID NOT MOVE, a query slipped through and the line CI prints
  // said exactly what it said the day before. Nothing in the repo asserted
  // those numbers, so the only thing standing between a silent evasion and a
  // green build was a human noticing that a three-digit total had not changed.
  //
  // Pinning them turns every movement into a deliberate edit. A legitimate
  // change WILL fail this: when it does, read the new numbers, satisfy yourself
  // that each one moved for a reason you can name, and update them here in the
  // same commit as the change that moved them.
  // MOVED 88 -> 89 by Phase 4 Task 2. GET /team/activity is the one statement
  // in that phase that references `entries`: its second UNION arm joins the
  // table so a share event is emitted only for a memory the caller may read,
  // `JOIN entries m ON m.id = ev.entry_id AND m.${scope.clause}`, the caller's
  // own scope, carried in the ON clause. The checker read the whole compound as
  // ONE query, so this is +1 and not +2, recorded as the tool printed it, with
  // the SQL left in the shape the paging correctness needs rather than reshaped
  // for the lexer. Exceptions stay 49 and scope-checked stays 7: nothing was
  // exempted.
  //
  // The later change from LEFT JOIN to JOIN, which is what made that predicate
  // govern the ROW SET rather than only the title, moved NONE of the three
  // numbers, since the checker's unit is the query and its verdict was already
  // "satisfied". Re-run and confirmed at 89/49/7. That silence is what the
  // outer-join rule was written to end, and adding it moved two of the numbers:
  //
  //   queries        89 -> 89, UNCHANGED. The rule changes a VERDICT, not what
  //                  counts as a query: no statement is newly seen or newly
  //                  dropped, and holding this number still while the others
  //                  move is itself the evidence that nothing vanished.
  //   exempt         49 -> 48. src/routes/admin.ts's /patterns source hydration
  //                  is the ONE statement in src/ with the shape, `FROM edges e
  //                  LEFT JOIN entries m ON ... AND m.${mScope.clause}`, and it
  //                  carried a scope-exempt licence written for its OTHER alias.
  //                  scope-exempt no longer answers an outer-join finding, so
  //                  that annotation became a scope-outer-join one whose reason
  //                  now has to say why nulling m.content is enough. -1 here,
  //                  +1 below: a licence moved between kinds, none was added.
  //   scope-checked  7 -> 7, UNCHANGED. Nothing about a clause assembled in
  //                  JavaScript changed.
  //   outer-join     0 -> 1, the new fourth count. One statement in src/, named
  //                  above. GET /team/activity is NOT among them: its join is
  //                  INNER, so its ON clause is a row filter and it passes on
  //                  the merits, which is the whole point of pinning it.
  //
  // MOVED 48 -> 47 by the per-company novelty floor in src/insight/weekly.ts.
  // That query's workspace predicate used to be an interpolated `${floorSliceClause}`
  //, invisible to the lexer, so it needed a `scope-exempt:` licence. Narrowing
  // the floor to the drawn candidates' own workspaces put a LITERAL
  // `workspace_id IN (?, …)` in the source, which the checker is satisfied by on
  // the merits, and the licence became one nothing used. It was removed rather
  // than left in place: a dead licence is a sentence a future reader would trust.
  //
  //   queries        89 -> 89, UNCHANGED. One prepare() was replaced by one
  //                  prepare(); nothing was newly seen or newly dropped, and
  //                  holding this still while exempt moves is the evidence of it.
  //   exempt         48 -> 47, the licence named above, removed and not moved.
  //   scope-checked  7 -> 7, UNCHANGED. Nothing about a clause assembled in
  //                  JavaScript changed, the clause stopped being assembled in
  //                  JavaScript, which is why it landed in neither bucket.
  //   outer-join     1 -> 1, UNCHANGED. The floor's read is a bare FROM.
  //
  // The SQL was NOT reshaped to please the lexer: the predicate is literal
  // because the workspace list is now bounded by WEEKLY_CANDIDATE_LIMIT rather
  // than by the slice, which is the fix, and the lexer's opinion of it followed.
  //
  // MOVED queries 90 -> 91 by src/prompt-capsule/build.ts. The new Prompt
  // Capsule candidate read contains `${scope.clause}` directly in predicate
  // position, so the checker passes it on its merits: it needs no exception or
  // scope-checked licence. All three licence counts therefore remain fixed.
  //
  // MOVED queries 100 -> 101 by the dashboard's new GET /stats/activity
  // (src/routes/admin.ts): one statement, splicing scope.clause directly into
  // its WHERE, so it passes on its merits. Exempt/scope-checked/outer-join are
  // all UNCHANGED: no new exception was needed, nothing was assembled in JS,
  // and no outer join was involved.
  //
  // MOVED queries 101 -> 103 by the dashboard's new GET /stats/recalled
  // (src/routes/admin.ts): two statements, the row read and the
  // total_recalls sum, each splicing scope.clause directly into its WHERE.
  // Exempt/scope-checked/outer-join are again all UNCHANGED.
  //
  // As the tool printed it:
  //   ✔ scope check: 103 queries, 53 documented exceptions, 7 scope-checked
