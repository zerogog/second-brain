/**
 * The value panel's screen-to-quote table (`installer/src/valuePanel.ts`).
 *
 * Same arrangement as `test/unit/steps.test.ts`: the render lives in `main.ts`
 * and cannot be imported outside a webview, so the part that is a decision
 * rather than a render — which screen shows which testimonial, which screens
 * show none, and which quotes are long enough to need the smaller of the
 * band's two type steps — is a module of plain data with its own tests.
 *
 * The failures worth guarding here are the ones a screenshot would not show.
 * A quote that changed between two renders of the same screen looks fine in
 * any single frame and is only wrong in motion. A screen missing from the
 * table would be a band that silently stopped appearing halfway through
 * setup. And a testimonial on the progress screen would be marketing copy
 * next to a progress bar, which no reviewer would catch unless provisioning
 * happened to be running while they looked.
