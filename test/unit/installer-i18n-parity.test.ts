/**
 * The desktop app's two message catalogs, checked against each other.
 *
 * This check did not exist. `installer/src/i18n/{en,it}.ts` are constrained by
 * the `Messages` interface, but CI never compiles the installer's TypeScript —
 * the workflow runs `npm run bundle-worker` and `cargo check` there and nothing
 * else — so a key added to `en.ts` and forgotten in `it.ts` shipped a compile
 * error nobody ran, and a key present in both but left in English shipped a
 * silent regression. Importing both catalogs here is what makes the Italian
 * half of any copy change real rather than assumed, and it works for the same
 * reason `test/unit/rotation-screens.test.ts` works: these files import nothing
 * but each other's types.
