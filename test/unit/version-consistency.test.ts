/**
 * The app version lives in five files that must agree, and nothing but habit
 * kept them aligned.
 *
 * They drift in ways that are quiet and expensive. tauri.conf.json is what the
 * built app reports and what the updater compares against; Cargo.toml is what
 * `cargo` stamps into the binary; installer/package.json is what npm sees;
 * package-lock.json is what `npm ci` installs from, and npm calls a lockfile
 * whose version disagrees with package.json out of sync; and Cargo.lock is
 * regenerated from Cargo.toml, so a bump that forgets `cargo update` leaves the
 * lockfile behind and the next build rewrites it as an unrelated diff.
 *
 * package-lock.json is here because it was the one this test did not cover.
 * release.mjs never wrote it, so it sat two releases stale — 1.2.3 while the app
 * shipped 1.3.1 — and nothing failed, which is exactly how it survived that long.
 *
 * scripts/release.mjs writes the first four and runs cargo update for the fifth.
 * This test is what makes that the only correct path — a hand-edited bump that
 * misses a file fails CI on the branch rather than at release time.
